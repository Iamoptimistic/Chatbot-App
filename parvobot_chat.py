    "what are the symptoms of parvovirus": "Dogs with parvo often have vomiting, foul-smelling diarrhea (sometimes bloody), loss of appetite, lethargy, and fever. Puppies can get very sick very quickly.",
    "how can it be prevented": "Vaccination is key! Puppies need a series of shots starting around 6‚Äì8 weeks of age. Also, good hygiene and keeping sick dogs away from healthy ones helps a lot.",
