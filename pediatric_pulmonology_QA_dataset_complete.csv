Childhood Asthma,What is the cause of childhood asthma?,Aetiology,"The exact cause of childhood asthma is not fully understood, but it is believed to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Children with a family history of asthma or allergies, exposure to tobacco smoke, air pollution, respiratory infections early in life, and increased immune system sensitivity are at greater risk. In asthma, triggers such as allergens, infections, cold air, or exercise lead to airway inflammation, bronchoconstriction, and mucus production."
Childhood Asthma,What are the main symptoms of childhood asthma?,Symptoms,"Symptoms include wheezing, coughing (especially at night or with exertion), shortness of breath, chest tightness, fatigue due to poor sleep, and difficulty breathing during play. In severe cases, signs like chest retractions, use of accessory muscles, or cyanosis may appear. Symptoms vary over time and can be triggered by infections, allergens, cold air, or physical activity."
Childhood Asthma,How is childhood asthma diagnosed?,Diagnosis,"Diagnosis is based on a combination of history, physical exam, and pulmonary function tests like spirometry (especially in children over 5). Tests may include bronchoprovocation or measuring exhaled nitric oxide. In children under 5, diagnosis relies heavily on symptom history and response to bronchodilators, due to difficulty performing lung function tests."
Childhood Asthma,What are common triggers of childhood asthma?,Causes,"Triggers include viral infections, tobacco smoke, air pollution, cold air, pollen, dust mites, pet dander, mold, exercise, and strong emotional reactions. Sometimes symptoms occur without a known trigger."
Childhood Asthma,How can childhood asthma be prevented or controlled?,Prevention,"Although asthma can’t be cured, it can be controlled through avoidance of triggers, maintaining a healthy weight, managing GERD if present, and adhering to treatment. Preventive strategies include using air filters, avoiding tobacco smoke, regular exercise, and using an asthma action plan to monitor symptoms."
Childhood Asthma,What are the treatment options for childhood asthma?,Treatment,"Treatment involves long-term control medications and quick-relief medications. Long-term options include inhaled corticosteroids, leukotriene modifiers, and combination inhalers. Quick-relief includes short-acting beta agonists like albuterol. Immunomodulatory agents may be used in severe cases. Treatment plans are tailored based on age, severity, and trigger response."
Childhood Asthma,What is the role of an asthma action plan?,Management,"An asthma action plan helps caregivers and healthcare providers manage asthma proactively. It includes symptom tracking, medication use, peak flow measurements, and emergency instructions. Zones (green, yellow, red) indicate control status and guide treatment adjustments."
Childhood Asthma,What are complications of uncontrolled asthma in children?,Complications,"Complications include hospitalizations due to severe attacks, poor school attendance, impaired lung function, sleep disturbance, physical inactivity, and overall reduced quality of life. Long-term inflammation can also lead to airway remodeling."
Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia,What causes bronchopulmonary dysplasia in infants?,Aetiology,"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is primarily caused by lung injury in premature infants who require prolonged oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation. These treatments, while life-saving, can overstretch and damage the delicate lung tissues and alveoli, leading to inflammation, scarring, and impaired lung development."
Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia,What are the clinical signs and symptoms of bronchopulmonary dysplasia?,Symptoms,"Symptoms of BPD include difficulty breathing, rapid breathing (tachypnea), wheezing, cyanosis (bluish skin, lips, or nails), apnea (pauses in breathing), and low blood oxygen levels. Infants may also experience feeding difficulties and require supplemental oxygen for extended periods."
Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia,Who is at risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia?,Risk Factors,"Infants born more than 10 weeks prematurely, especially those weighing less than 2 pounds, are at highest risk. Other risk factors include underdeveloped lungs, existing respiratory distress, and the need for prolonged oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation. It is rare in infants born after 32 weeks of gestation."
Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia,How can bronchopulmonary dysplasia be prevented?,Prevention,"Preventing premature birth is the most effective way to prevent BPD. Strategies include proper prenatal care, avoiding tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drugs, and managing maternal health conditions. Reducing exposure to oxygen and mechanical ventilation by using gentler respiratory support methods also lowers the risk of BPD."
Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia,How is bronchopulmonary dysplasia treated?,Treatment,"There is no cure for BPD, but treatment focuses on supporting lung function and reducing inflammation. This includes supplemental oxygen, nutrition support, diuretics to reduce fluid in the lungs, bronchodilators to ease breathing, corticosteroids to reduce inflammation, and prevention of infections with agents like palivizumab. Severe cases may require tracheostomy or mechanical ventilation."
Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia,What is the long-term outlook for infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia?,Prognosis,"Most infants recover from BPD by age 5, but some may continue to have respiratory issues into childhood or adulthood, including asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, or increased susceptibility to infections. Developmental delays, growth problems, and pulmonary hypertension are possible in severe cases. Regular follow-up and multidisciplinary care are essential."
Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia,How is bronchopulmonary dysplasia diagnosed?,Diagnosis,"Diagnosis is based on clinical history—particularly the need for oxygen therapy beyond 28 days after birth in a preterm infant—and radiologic findings on chest X-ray. Other supportive tests include blood oxygen levels, echocardiogram to rule out pulmonary hypertension, and clinical examination of respiratory status."
Cystic Fibrosis,What causes cystic fibrosis?,Aetiology,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator), which affect the production and function of the CFTR protein. This protein regulates the movement of salt and water in and out of cells. Defective CFTR results in thick, sticky secretions that block airways and ducts in the lungs, pancreas, and other organs. CF is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning a child must inherit a defective gene from both parents to develop the disease."
Cystic Fibrosis,What are the symptoms of cystic fibrosis?,Symptoms,"Symptoms of CF vary but commonly include a persistent cough with thick mucus, repeated lung infections, wheezing, shortness of breath, poor growth, salty-tasting skin, nasal polyps, and frequent sinus infections. Digestive symptoms include greasy, foul-smelling stools, difficulty gaining weight, intestinal blockage, and severe constipation. Infants may show delayed growth or failure to pass meconium."
Cystic Fibrosis,How is cystic fibrosis diagnosed?,Diagnosis,"CF is diagnosed through newborn screening, sweat chloride testing, and genetic testing. The sweat test is the gold standard and measures elevated salt levels in sweat. Genetic testing identifies mutations in the CFTR gene. Additional diagnostic tools include pulmonary function tests, imaging studies (e.g., chest X-rays), and assessment of pancreatic function."
Cystic Fibrosis,Can cystic fibrosis be prevented?,Prevention,"Cystic fibrosis cannot be prevented, but genetic counseling and carrier screening can help prospective parents understand their risk of passing on the condition. Prenatal genetic testing is available if both parents are carriers, although it may not detect all mutations."
Cystic Fibrosis,How is cystic fibrosis treated?,Treatment,"Treatment includes airway clearance techniques (e.g., chest physiotherapy, vibrating vests), inhaled medications (bronchodilators, antibiotics, mucolytics), and CFTR modulator drugs (e.g., Trikafta). Nutritional support with pancreatic enzyme replacement, fat-soluble vitamins, and high-calorie diets is crucial. Lung transplant may be considered in advanced cases. Management also involves regular monitoring by a multidisciplinary team in CF care centers."
Cystic Fibrosis,What complications are associated with cystic fibrosis?,Complications,"CF can cause bronchiectasis, respiratory failure, lung infections, nasal polyps, diabetes, liver disease, infertility (especially in males), osteoporosis, and gastrointestinal complications such as bowel obstructions. There is also an increased risk of digestive tract cancers and mental health challenges due to chronic illness."
Cystic Fibrosis,What is the epidemiology of cystic fibrosis?,Epidemiology,"Cystic fibrosis is most common in white individuals of Northern European descent, with an incidence of about 1 in 2,500 to 3,500 births in the United States. It affects males and females equally. The disease is less common in people of African, Asian, and Hispanic ancestry, often resulting in delayed diagnosis in these populations."
Pediatric Reactive Airway Disease,What causes pediatric reactive airway disease?,Aetiology,"Pediatric reactive airway disease (RAD) is a general term used to describe symptoms similar to asthma in children who are too young for a definitive asthma diagnosis. It is often caused by airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness in response to infections, allergens, cold air, or environmental irritants. The condition may reflect an early manifestation of asthma or be associated with transient wheezing due to viral infections in infants and toddlers."
Pediatric Reactive Airway Disease,What are the clinical signs and symptoms of pediatric reactive airway disease?,Symptoms,"Common symptoms include wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, tachypnea (rapid breathing), intercostal retractions, nasal flaring, and cyanosis in severe cases. Children may also show signs like poor feeding, fatigue, sweating, or an increased anteroposterior chest diameter. These symptoms often resemble those of asthma."
Pediatric Reactive Airway Disease,How is pediatric reactive airway disease diagnosed?,Diagnosis,"Diagnosis of RAD is largely clinical and based on the presence of episodic wheezing and respiratory symptoms, especially in children under 5. Definitive diagnosis of asthma requires lung function tests, which are not typically feasible in very young children. Other causes of wheezing such as infections, GERD, or congenital anomalies must be ruled out. RAD may be a placeholder diagnosis until more definitive criteria are met."
Pediatric Reactive Airway Disease,How is pediatric reactive airway disease treated?,Treatment,"Treatment often includes bronchodilators like albuterol delivered via nebulizer or inhaler with a spacer to relieve wheezing and shortness of breath. In more severe cases, corticosteroids may be used to reduce airway inflammation. Supportive care includes oxygen supplementation if needed and treating any underlying infections."
Pediatric Reactive Airway Disease,What are the complications of reactive airway disease in children?,Complications,"If not properly managed, RAD may lead to recurrent respiratory infections, persistent wheezing, and possible progression to chronic asthma. Severe episodes can result in respiratory distress, hospitalization, and missed developmental milestones. Long-term use of steroids can have side effects like growth suppression."
Pediatric Reactive Airway Disease,What factors increase the risk of pediatric reactive airway disease?,Risk Factors,"Risk factors include a family history of asthma or allergies, exposure to environmental smoke or pollutants, viral respiratory infections, premature birth, and poor socioeconomic conditions. Children with atopic conditions such as eczema or allergic rhinitis are also at higher risk."
